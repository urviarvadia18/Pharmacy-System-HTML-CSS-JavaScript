                        <p>Joints connects two bones. They provide support and help when you move. Any harm to the joints from disease or injury can affect your 
                            movement and cause a lot of pain. Joints pain may be caused by various types of injuries or conditions which affects the ligament, 
                            tendons or muscles surrounding the joint and may be even bones and cartilage in the joints. </p>

                        <h3>Homeopathic Medicines -The father of modern medicine</h3>
                        <p>Homeopathy is more than 200 year-old medical science based on the principle “like cures like”. This means if an
                             element can cause symptoms in a healthy person, it can cause self-healing of similar symptoms in a sick person. Imagine that a person 
                             comes into contact with poison ivy, now he will develop skin rashes accompanied by burning, itching, swelling and painful blisters. </p>
